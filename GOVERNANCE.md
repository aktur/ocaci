# Governance

> 🚧 **Working Draft** — This document outlines our initial governance model. Feedback and contributions are strongly encouraged.

The **Open Collective of AWS Certified Independents (OCACI)** project is a community-owned effort dedicated to supporting independent AWS-certified consultants. Our governance model emphasizes openness, transparency, and shared ownership.

---

## 📌 Principles

- **Community ownership**: No single individual or entity controls this project.
- **Transparency**: Decisions, finances, and processes are public.
- **Consensus-based decisions**: Major decisions are reached by community consensus.
- **Inclusive and welcoming**: Any independent AWS-certified consultant active on AWS IQ can participate. Future membership criteria for direct enrollment will be decided by the community once AWS IQ winds down.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Roles

### Members
Contributors who have explicitly agreed to the [Community Principles](README.md) and added themselves to our directory.

### Maintainers
Trusted members with merge rights and repo admin privileges.

**Responsibilities**:
- Review and merge contributions
- Facilitate community discussions
- Oversee project direction and governance

**Becoming a Maintainer**:
- Actively contribute through meaningful PRs or discussions
- Demonstrate alignment with community values
- Nominated by existing maintainers and approved through consensus

### GitHub Organization Owners
Maintain GitHub admin settings, finances, and infrastructure. This role involves operational trust but does not confer additional decision-making power.

---

## 🗳️ Decision-Making
- Routine decisions: Handled by maintainers via "lazy consensus" (no objections after ~72 hours).
- Major decisions (governance changes, significant tooling shifts): Open issue for community discussion; consensus required among maintainers.
- Any disputes: resolved openly in GitHub discussions.

---

## 📬 Joining the Community
See [JOINING.md](JOINING.md) for detailed instructions on how to become a member of OCACI.

---

## 📅 Member Inactivity & Exit
- Members can voluntarily leave by submitting a PR removing their entry.
- Members inactive for over 12 months may be marked inactive or removed by consensus after attempts at contact.

---

## 💰 Funding & Finances
Any project-related expenses (domains, infrastructure, tooling) will be transparently funded and tracked through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com).

---

## ⚖️ Conflict of Interest
Always transparently disclose commercial interests. Avoid using the community solely for self-promotion.
